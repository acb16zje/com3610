# Finding Security Issues in (Open Source) Software Repositories

* **ID:** 2018-tuos-adb-ug-10a

## Description

Not all Free/Libre and Open Source (FLOSS) Projects publish fixed
software vulnerabilities in an easy to consume manner (e.g., as
CVEs). Moreover, even if they do, it is often not easy to identify the
actual code commit fixing a security vulnerability.

As for users of FLOSS components, it is important to understand which
vulnerabilities are known and when/how they were fixed, it is
important to have an in-depth understanding of vulnerabilities in FLOSS
components (of course, also for an attacker/hacker, this information
is of value).

In this project, a repository mining tool should be developed that
is, e.g., able to detect

* silent patches/fixed, i.e., commits that fix security
  vulnerabilities that are not yet known
* commits that fix known vulnerabilities

The project can be extended to learn/derive from the identified
commits configuration for security testing tools that help to decide
if an application using the component is affected by the vulnerability
or not.

## Skills required:

 * Good programming skills
 * Good understating of source code control systems (e.g. git)
 * An interest in application security

## Initial reading and useful links:

 * OWASP Top 10: <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project>
 * <https://github.com/TQRG/secbench-mining-tool>

# Cohort: l3int (78%)

## Supervisor: A.Brucker

### Student performance (supervisor only)
Zer Jun is very much engaged with the project and works very goal-oriented. His time management is
excellent.

### Amount of work completed
A significant amount of work, in form of a high-quality literature survey, has been completed. As a
next step, it is important that the actual implementation is started.

### Analysis
The analysis shows a deep understanding of the problem at hand, including a clear definition of the
scope of the project.

### Time Plan
The time plan is nicely broken down into several phases and covers all important aspects.

### Literature Survey or Background Information
The survey and background sections is clearly structured and covers all important works in the
necessary details.

### Report Presentation
The presentation is of high quality (both, in terms of actual content and in terms of
language/layout).

### General comments
Overall, an excellent analysis and survey stage report.

### Amount of work completed
A thorough literature review has been undertaken and a clear plan has been put in place together
with initial basic implementations.

### Analysis
The aims of the project are described accurately and a clearly defined plan is in place. The project
though seems very ambitious given the amount of time available. Several challenges (risks) have been
identified. I am not sure that plans have been put in place to face such contingencies if they
occur.

### Time Plan
As said above, the time plan is very ambitious.

### Literature Survey or Background Information
The literature survey is very broad and to the point. It is well written with very rare English
language mistakes. Usually in the use of singular/plural.

### Report Presentation
The presentation is of high quality. The only flaw is that acronyms should be explained the first
time they are introduced. The abstract was incomprehensible to me the first time I read it.

### General comments
The student has clearly worked hard towards the production of this report. As a non-expert it is
unclear how likely the risks are and whether they may compromise seriously the outcomes of the
project.

# Cohort: l3 (85%)

## Supervisor: A.Brucker

### Student performance (supervisor only)
Zer Jun's engagement with the project, since start of semester 1, was outstanding. The overall
results of this project surpass the expectations both in quality and quantity.

### Quality of Products
The developed tool is of very high quality and will be used in future research. In particular, the
tool is extensible, it has a clear and well-defined (command-line) interface, and the code is well
structured, allowing for future extensions.

### Quality of Processes
A clear and well structured process has been followed. The work was nicely distributed across the
whole academic year.

### Quality of Evaluation
The evaluation, covering both unit tests and the analysis of large real world repositories, has been
done very thoroughly. The results are impressive and provide interesting insights for future
research.

### Amount of work completed
An outstanding amount of work has been implemented.

### Presentation
Both the poster presentation and the report are well structured. In particular, the poster
presentation also covered edge cases that could not be found using the developed approach.

### Poster Session

### General comments
The project is an extremely well done project and Zer Jun showed an extraordinary understanding of
the problem and was always eager to improve the approach further.

### Quality of Products
The promised repository mining tool has been developed as promised in the interim report. A true
positive rate of 44% is reported.Also false positive rates were promised, bit I could not spot any
data about this.

### Quality of Processes
The introduction of the report has been updated to reflect changes since the interim report.

### Quality of Evaluation
On one hand no justification is provided on whether the size of the used sample is large enough for
the rate to be considered accurate. On the other hand no comment is made related to how good or how
bad a 44% true positive rate is.

### Amount of work completed
A remarkable amount of work has been completed.

### Presentation
The presentation quality has improved over the already very good quality of the interim report.
Previous feedback has been implemented which is a measure to see.

### Poster Session

### General comments
A well exectuted project.
